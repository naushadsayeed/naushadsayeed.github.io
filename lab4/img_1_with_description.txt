<p>Computer programmer in making who's a current University student. I have plans in the future of being a Web Developer. I have been doing computer science and computer arts before I was in post-secondary school. I did my first computer science and arts when I was in grade 10. Then I continued doing computer science in grade 11 and 12. After that, I realized I want to be a web developer when I first started post-secondary school since that's where I first learned HTML/CSS.</p>
